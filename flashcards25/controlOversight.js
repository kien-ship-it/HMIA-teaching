    question: "Governance structures", 
    answer: "Formal roles or bodies empowered to monitor, evaluate, and intervene in the actions of other agents; ensure accountability and prevent drift.",

    question: "Auditing",

    question: "Access control",

    question: "Internal monitoring", 
    answer: "Continuous self-evaluation of system behavior through sensors, logs, or embedded auditing; supports real-time oversight.",
