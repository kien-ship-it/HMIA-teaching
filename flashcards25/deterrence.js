  { 
    question: "Deterrence", 
    answer: "Prevention of misaligned or harmful behavior by ensuring that violations reliably trigger negative consequences; alignment through anticipation of cost.", 
    tags: ["deterrence"], 
    course: ["HMIA"]
  },
  { 
    question: "Sanction", 
    answer: "A structured penalty or negative feedback applied when an agent violates a norm or rule, reinforcing alignment by linking misconduct to cost.", 
    tags: ["deterrence"], 
    course: ["HMIA"]
  },
  { 
    question: "Impunity", 
    answer: "A condition in which violations go unpunished, signaling that rules are unenforced and encouraging further misalignment.", 
    tags: ["deterrence"], 
    course: ["HMIA"]
  },
  { 
    question: "Proportionality", 
    answer: "Principle that sanctions should be scaled to the gravity and intent of the violation; excessive or trivial punishments undermine legitimacy.", 
    tags: ["deterrence"], 
    course: ["HMIA"]
  },
  { 
    question: "Credibility (of deterrent)", 
    answer: "The degree to which a threat of punishment is believable and likely to be enforced; essential for deterrence to shape expectations.", 
    tags: ["deterrence"], 
    course: ["HMIA"]
  },
  { 
    question: "Third-party enforcement", 
    answer: "Punishment or oversight carried out by neutral or external actors, ensuring impartiality and avoiding conflicts of interest.", 
    tags: ["deterrence"], 
    course: ["HMIA"]
  },
  { 
    question: "Decentralized punishment", 
    answer: "Enforcement distributed among peers or group members rather than centralized authority; sustains cooperation through collective accountability.", 
    tags: ["deterrence"], 
    course: ["HMIA"]
  },
  { 
    question: "Moral hazard", 
    answer: "When agents are insulated from the consequences of their actions, encouraging risk or self-serving behavior and weakening deterrence.", 
    tags: ["deterrence"], 
    course: ["HMIA"]
  },
  { 
    question: "Perverse incentives", 
    answer: "Reward structures that unintentionally promote undesired or misaligned behavior — 'rewarding A while hoping for B.'", 
    tags: ["deterrence"], 
    course: ["HMIA"]
  },
  { 
    question: "Selective enforcement", 
    answer: "Inconsistent or biased application of rules across actors or situations, undermining fairness and deterrence credibility.", 
    tags: ["deterrence"], 
    course: ["HMIA"]
  },
  { 
    question: "General deterrence", 
    answer: "The preventive effect of punishment on others who observe or anticipate it; discourages violations through example.", 
    tags: ["deterrence"], 
    course: ["HMIA"]
  },
  { 
    question: "Specific deterrence", 
    answer: "The effect of punishment on the punished individual, discouraging repeat misbehavior through direct experience.", 
    tags: ["deterrence"], 
    course: ["HMIA"]
  },
  { 
    question: "Moral repugnance", 
    answer: "Deterrence rooted in emotional aversion, shame, or guilt rather than fear of punishment; reflects internalized alignment with shared values.", 
    tags: ["deterrence"], 
    course: ["HMIA"]
  },
  { 
    question: "Certainty, severity, and celerity", 
    answer: "Classical triad of deterrence effectiveness: certainty (punishment will occur), severity (punishment is strong enough), and celerity (punishment is swift).", 
    tags: ["deterrence"], 
    course: ["HMIA"]
