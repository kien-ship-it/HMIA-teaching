  {
    question: "What is analogical reasoning?",
    answer: "A form of reasoning where knowledge from a familiar situation (source) is mapped onto a new or unfamiliar situation (target) based on perceived similarity.",
    tags: ["analogy"]
  },
  {
    question: "What is a source problem in analogy?",
    answer: "The familiar situation or past example that provides a candidate solution to be applied to a new problem.",
    tags: ["analogy"]
  },
  {
    question: "What is a target problem in analogy?",
    answer: "The new or unfamiliar situation to which a strategy or solution from a source problem is applied.",
    tags: ["analogy"]
  },
  {
    question: "What is similarity mapping?",
    answer: "The cognitive process of identifying shared characteristics between the source and the target in analogical reasoning.",
    tags: ["analogy"]
  },
  {
    question: "What is confirmation bias in analogical reasoning?",
    answer: "The tendency to favor information that supports an existing analogy while ignoring evidence that contradicts it.",
    tags: ["bias", "analogy"]
  },
  {
    question: "What is anchoring in analogical reasoning?",
    answer: "The cognitive bias where initial ideas or analogies strongly influence subsequent thinking, even if they're irrelevant.",
    tags: ["bias", "analogy"]
  },
  {
    question: "What is a superficial similarity?",
    answer: "A resemblance between source and target based on irrelevant or non-causal features, which can lead to faulty analogies.",
    tags: ["analogy"]
  },
  {
    question: "What is a deep similarity?",
    answer: "A resemblance between source and target based on essential causal features that influence outcomes, making the analogy more reliable.",
    tags: ["analogy"]
  },
  {
    question: "How is analogy used in strategic thinking?",
    answer: "Executives often apply strategies from familiar industries to new ones by identifying structurally similar challenges and opportunities.",
    tags: [ "analogy"]
  },
  {
    question: "What role does analogy play in case-based learning?",
    answer: "It allows students to build a repertoire of secondhand experiences and practice recognizing deep structural similarities across cases.",
    tags: ["analogy"]
  },{
    question: "What is transfer learning and how is it related to analogy?",
    answer: "Transfer learning in machine learning is where knowledge gained in one domain is applied to a different but related task—similar to how analogies transfers solutions from familiar to new situations.",
    tags: ["analogy", "transfer"]
  }
  ,{
    question: "How do humans and machines differ in analogical reasoning?",
    answer: "Humans excel at spotting similarities with limited data but are prone to bias + superficiality. Machines require large datasets and struggle with flexibility but avoid some cognitive biases.",
