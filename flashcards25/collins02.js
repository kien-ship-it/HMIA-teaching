  {
    question: "Rationality",
    answer: "Rationality refers to the use of reason and calculation to make decisions. In sociology, it’s often divided into functional (means-end) and substantive (value-oriented) rationality.",
    tags: ["Collins"]
  },
  {
    question: "Functional rationality",
    answer: "The efficient selection of means to achieve a given goal, without questioning whether the goal itself is good or worthwhile.",
    tags: ["Collins"]
  },
  {
    question: "Substantive rationality",
    answer: "Evaluation of whether the goals or ends themselves are meaningful, ethical, or desirable.",
    tags: ["Collins"]
  },
  {
    question: "Bureaucracy",
    answer: "A rule-based organizational structure meant to be efficient. It can become irrational when rules are followed blindly and outcomes suffer.",
    tags: ["Collins"]
  },
  {
    question: "Unintended consequences",
    answer: "Outcomes of actions that were not foreseen or intended, often resulting from attempts at rational planning.",
    tags: ["Collins"]
  },
  {
    question: "Solidarity",
    answer: "Social unity or togetherness. Collins (following Durkheim) argues it's formed through nonrational means like ritual, not just rational agreement.",
    tags: ["Collins"]
  },
  {
    question: "Precontractual solidarity",
    answer: "Durkheim’s term for the trust and shared norms that must exist before contracts or formal agreements can function.",
    tags: ["Collins"]
  },
  {
    question: "Social contract",
    answer: "The idea that society is founded by a rational agreement among individuals. Collins argues this can't explain trust or cooperation without a deeper, nonrational foundation.",
    tags: ["Collins"]
  },
  {
    question: "Infinite regress",
    answer: "A logical problem where each justification depends on another. Collins uses it to show that rational trust-building fails without a nonrational stopping point.",
    tags: ["Collins"]
  },
  {
    question: "Free rider problem",
    answer: "When individuals benefit from a collective good without contributing to it. Example: using public transit for free while others pay voluntarily.",
    tags: ["Collins"]
  },
  {
    question: "Nonrational",
    answer: "Social behavior driven by emotion, habit, or ritual rather than deliberate reasoning—not irrational, but extra-rational.",
    tags: ["Collins"]
  },
  {
    question: "Trust",
    answer: "Confidence in the reliability or goodwill of others—shown to be foundational to social cooperation but not fully explainable by rational calculation.",
    tags: ["Collins"]
  },
  {
    question: "Ritual",
    answer: "A shared, often symbolic social activity that creates emotional bonds and solidarity, enabling cooperation and trust.",
    tags: ["Collins"]
  },
  {
    question: "Social order",
    answer: "The stable patterning of behavior and cooperation that makes society function—something Collins argues cannot be created by reason alone.",
    tags: ["Collins"]
  },
  {
    question: "Ethnomethodology",
    answer: "A sociological approach that studies the everyday methods people use to make sense of social life. Collins connects it to Durkheimian ritual.",
    tags: ["Collins"]
  },
  {
    question: "Conflict theory",
    answer: "A sociological framework emphasizing power, inequality, and domination. Collins aligns with this tradition but sees it as rooted in group solidarity.",
    tags: ["Collins"]
  },
  {
    question: "Durkheimian microsociology",
    answer: "The study of how small-scale rituals and group interactions create solidarity—used by Collins to explain the basis of cooperation.",
    tags: ["Collins"]
  },
  {
    question: "Weberian bureaucracy",
    answer: "A rational-legal system of organized authority based on rules and expertise, which can become dysfunctional when ends are ignored.",
    tags: ["Collins"]
  },
  {
    question: "Legitimacy",
    answer: "The belief that social arrangements or authorities are rightful. It is often maintained through ritual and nonrational means.",
    tags: ["Collins"]
  },
  {
    question: "Social integration",
    answer: "The degree to which individuals feel connected to and part of a collective, often through shared values or emotional ties.",
