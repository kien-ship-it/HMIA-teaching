  {
    question: "Alignment Problem",
    answer: "The challenge of ensuring AI systems do what humans intend—not just what we explicitly tell them. E.g., boat goes for points not proper racing.",
    tags: ["Christian"]
  },
  {
    question: "Rewarding A while hoping for B",
    answer: "A classic misalignment failure: systems optimize for measurable proxies that don't match human intentions.",
    tags: ["Christian"]
  },
  {
    question: "Machine Learning (ML)",
    answer: "A method where computers learn patterns from data, instead of being explicitly programmed.",
    tags: ["Christian"]
  },
  {
    question: "Unsupervised Learning",
    answer: "A type of ML where the system finds patterns in data without labeled outcomes. E.g., learning word associations from text corpora.",
    tags: ["Christian"]
  },
  {
    question: "Supervised Learning",
    answer: "ML that uses labeled data (input-output pairs) to learn a predictive function. E.g., learning behavior prediction from historical records.",
    tags: ["Christian"]
  },
  {
    question: "Reinforcement Learning (RL)",
    answer: "ML where an agent learns by trial and error in an environment with rewards and penalties.",
    tags: ["Christian"]
  },
  {
    question: "Word Embeddings",
    answer: "Numerical representations of words capturing their meanings based on context. E.g., king - man + woman = queen",
    tags: ["Christian"]
  },
  {
    question: "word2vec",
    answer: "A specific algorithm that learns word embeddings from large text datasets.",
    tags: ["Christian"]
  },
  {
    question: "Bias in AI",
    answer: "Systematic errors or unfair outcomes resulting from data, models, or assumptions. E.g., resume bot prefers male-coded words.",
    tags: ["Christian"]
  },
  {
    question: "Proxy Variable",
    answer: "A stand-in metric used when the true goal is hard to measure. E.g., points instead of playing game well.",
    tags: ["Christian"]
  },
  {
    question: "Objective Function",
    answer: "The formal specification of what an AI should optimize. E.g., the score in a game.",
    tags: ["Christian"]
  },
  {
    question: "Neural Network",
    answer: "A computing model inspired by the brain, used to identify patterns in data.",
    tags: ["Christian"]
  },
  {
    question: "Perceptron",
    answer: "An early neural network model that could learn to recognize patterns.",
    tags: ["Christian"]
  },

    question: "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)",
    answer: "A method for adjusting weights in a neural network in the direction of minimizing error.",
    tags: ["Christian"]

  {
    question: "Risk-Assessment Algorithms",
    answer: "Tools that predict outcomes like recidivism to assist real-world decision-making.",
    tags: ["Christian"]
  },
  {
    question: "Black Box Model",
    answer: "A system whose internal workings are opaque or difficult to interpret. We just know the inputs and the outputs.",
    tags: ["Christian"]
  },
  {
    question: "General-Purpose AI",
    answer: "AI systems designed to perform a wide range of tasks, not just one.",
    tags: ["Christian"]
  },
  {
    question: "Debiasing",
    answer: "Techniques used to reduce or remove unwanted biases in AI models. E.g., tweaking word embeddings to remove gender bias.",

    question: "Principal Component Analysis (PCA)",
    answer: "A technique to identify the most important dimensions in high-dimensional data.",
    tags: ["Christian"]
  },
  {
    question: "Analogical Reasoning (in AI)",
    answer: "The ability to draw comparisons or analogies between concepts like when AI infers \"Rome\" from \"Paris - France + Italy\".",
